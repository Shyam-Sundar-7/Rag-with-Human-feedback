In very small settings, where you have one person responsible for \\nthis function, it is quite trivial. Challenges and friction start to arise when the variety and \\nquantity of models in a team start to scale. A selection of common friction points raised \\nby machine learning developers with regards to storing and retrieving models follows:\\n• Collaboration in larger teams\\n• Phasing out stale models in production\\n• The provenance of a model\\n• A lack of documentation for models\\n• Identifying the correct version of a model\\n• How to integrate the model with deployment tools\\nThe main idea behind MLflow Model Registry is to provide a central store model in an \\norganization where all the relevant models are stored and can be accessed by humans and \\nsystems. A good analogy would be a Git repository for models with associated relevant \\nmetadata and centralized state management for models.', metadata={'source': 'Natu Lauchande - Machine Learning Engineering with MLflow_ Manage the end-to-end machine learning life cycle with MLflow (2021, Packt Publishing) - libgen.li.pdf', 'page': 110}),\n",

So, being cloud-agnostic and being able to have \\nworkloads in different environments is a competitive advantage.\\nThese tenets will allow us to frame our systems architecture within an open and low-cost \\nsolution for the company and allow the flexibility of running on the different systems \\non-premises, in the cloud, or local.\\nWe have previously defined the business requirements of the prediction use cases, namely \\ndetection of the movement of cryptocurrency and value prediction.
